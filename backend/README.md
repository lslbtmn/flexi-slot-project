# FlexiSlot Backend

Spring Boot 3.2 REST API for the FlexiSlot SaaS MVP.

## Requirements

- Java 17
- Maven 3.8+
- MySQL 8 (e.g. XAMPP) running on `localhost:3306`

## Database Setup

1. Start MySQL (XAMPP Control Panel → Start MySQL).
2. Create database and apply schema:

```bash
mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS flexislot;"
mysql -u root flexislot < src/main/resources/db/schema.sql
```

Or run the SQL in `src/main/resources/db/schema.sql` via phpMyAdmin.

## Configuration

- `application.yml`: MySQL URL `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/flexislot`, user `root`, blank password.
- JWT secret and expiration are under `jwt.*`.

## Build & Run

```bash
mvn clean package
mvn spring-boot:run
```

API base: `http://localhost:8080/api`

- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui.html
- OpenAPI JSON: http://localhost:8080/api/v3/api-docs

## Seed Data

On first run (when no users exist), demo data is created:

| Email                 | Password   | Role           |
|-----------------------|------------|----------------|
| admin@flexislot.com   | admin123   | ADMIN          |
| owner@flexislot.com   | owner123   | BUSINESS_OWNER |
| customer@flexislot.com| customer123| CUSTOMER       |

## Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

## Security

- JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Roles: ADMIN, BUSINESS_OWNER, CUSTOMER.
- Business resources are scoped by owner; never trust client-supplied businessId for mutations.
- CORS allowed for `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default).
